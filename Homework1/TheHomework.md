## Overview and Origin

* Ripple

* Ripple was incorporated in 2012.

* Ripple was founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb.

* The idea of Ripple was birthed by Ryan Fugger while he worked on a local exchange trading system. Fugger’s intentions were to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger’s creation was later combined with the works and efforts of Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen developing a digital currency system in which transactions are verified by consensus among members of the network, as opposed to Bitcoin’s method.

* During the years of 2013 thru 2019 and 5 rounds of funding, Ripple received nearly $300 Million in funding from private funders. Ripple’s current main source of funding are the profits from sales of its digital currency XRP.

## Business Activities:

* Ripple’s goal is to solve the problems that exist with cross-border and cross-currency transactions and exchanges. Ripple operates as a currency “bridge” by providing a peer-to-peer decentralized platform that allows for a seamless transfer of money in any form.

* Ripple’s customer base consists of both individual consumers and large banking and lending institutions. Ripple’s XRP is reported to be the 5th largest cryptocurrency used today, reported by www.investopedia.com

* Ripple offers both faster and cheaper transactions than most of its major competitors. Also in contrast to competitors, Ripple uses a peer-to-peer validation system for transactions.

* Ripple operates on an open-source coding platform. Ripples use C++ coding language to implement its SHAMap blockchain technology. To manage, organize and capitalize from data collected, Ripple is currently implementing the Data Build Tool.

## Landscape:
* Ripple operates in the cryptocurrency/blockchain domain.

* Cryptocurrency first emerged in 2009 with the introduction of Bitcoin. The most significant stride in this market over the years has been change in the “black market” stigma attached to cryptocurrency. Crypto is now accepted by thousands of merchants worldwide. Cryptocurrency in now being used to solve cross-border and cross-currency exchange problems. Other major strides in this domain have been how the United States government views the status and usage of categorization of cryptocurrencies.

* Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest companies in this domain. Other serious market competitors are Dogecoin, Binance Coin, and Cardano.

## Results

* Ripple has ongoing legal battles with the Securities Exchange Commission. Ripple’s fight to change how cryptocurrencies are categorized and used could change the entire landscape of the crypto community.

* Some of the key metrics used to measure success in this domain are market capitalization, transaction cost to users, and valuation of currency. Ripple claims to have some of the fastest, cheapest, and hassle free transactions in the market.

* Ripple is the 5th largest cryptocurrency network in this domain based on market share and valuation of currency.

## Recommendations

* I would recommend that Ripple continues and widens its working within the gaming industry. Ripple has been doing work with the gaming company to implement blockchain technologies into their games. Together Ripple and Forte plan to deepen the gaming experience and offer different ways to interact in gaming economics. I do advise that once the blockchain foundation is set Ripple allows the gaming currency earned on the Forte platform  to be exchange as XRP bucks on Ripple’s trading platform.

* Globally gaming is a $140 billion industry. If Ripple were able to position themselves to capture a percentage  of the millions of games worldwide as Ripple Network users would benefit the company greatly.

* Fortunately, the expansion into the gaming world would not require anything new of Ripple. Forte would have to convert all of its operating to blockchain technologies This new service offering would require Forte to begin using Ripple’s open source protocol Interledger Protocol (ILP).

* The blockchain technology is the leading technology in the cryptocurrency domain.
